# CartPoleSwingUp
Swinging up and Stabilizing an Inverted Pendulum on a cart using Deep Reinforcement Learning
This project uses a Cartpole environment.

# Motivation
This project is the code for my thesis. IÂ´m studying at the technological University in Kaiserslautern. My degree course is Mechanical Engineering with applied computer science. 
At the University there is a real life pendulum which aim it is to swing up an stabilize. The pendulum has one joint and is fixed on a cart which is adjustet to a megnetic levition axis.
The goal from this script is to simulate the upswing and stabilasation. Afterwards the the trained data is used on the real life pendulum.
